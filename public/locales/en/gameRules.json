  "description": "Liar's poker is a card game that relates to poker. One of it's greatest advantages is the degree of freedom in terms of the number of players. You may find dozens of different variants of the game but the contents of this website are relevant to the one described below.",
  "rules": {
    "heading": "The rules",
    "deckAndObjective": "The game is played using a 24-card deck, ranging from nines to aces, with four suits of each rank. The objective is to predict a poker hand that occurs among all of the cards distributed among the players, based on the cards in the player's hand and declarations of the previous players. In the first round, each player is given one card. A chosen player starts the bidding by naming any poker combination, then the gameplay continues clockwise.",
    "playerActions": "Each subsequent player must take one of two available actions: guess a higher combination or check the previous player's declaration, therefore ending the round. If the player checks, everyone reveals their cards. If the previous guess turns out to be incorrect, the bidding player loses the round, otherwise loses the player who checked. All of the cards are shuffled and dealt once again, although this time the loser receives one more card than in the previous round. They now become the first player to bet.",
    "endCondition": "The game continues until one of the players receives his fifth card. At this point, the player with the fewest cards in his hand wins."

This variant ensures that even the highest poker hands at some point in the game will become fairly likely to be present. When the last card is dealt, the player with the most cards is kicked or the player with the fewest cards wins the game. It also might be a good solution to limit the number of cards that can be used from the deck, e.g. continuing the game until there are three undealt cards left in the deck."
